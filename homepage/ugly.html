        <p>
          I'm currently an undergraduate computer science wizard. I spend
          my spare time learning new things, and participating in duels. I think that
          it's really important to be a well-rounded person which is why I put an
          equal ammount of energy in to both technical and other areas of my life. I'm
          currently a three time runner up to be the Quittage captian. I'm also the best
          seeker on the team.

          I've worked at about 10 companys over the last 3 weeks, but I'll highlight the top
          three here for you.

            I pretty much rewrote the search egine here in assembly which ended up being 0.000000000000001% faster.
            for what ever reason my colleguages rejected my changes and I quote.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              The speed that you have claimed to add to the search engine is not worth the
              maintance costs to maintain 100 billion millon trillion lines of assembly code.

              Mark and I got along. We ended up throwing a pool party and flooding the entire basement.
              That took a while to clean up.

              I was excited about my job until I learned that it would take about a year to commute to Mars
              everyday and once I was there the internet would be slower than DSL.. I can deal with the
              commute but not being able to stream music for me was a deal breaker.

          I have a really really really really really really really really really really really really
          really really really really really really really really really long list of unique
          skills to demonstrate why I'd be an asset to your company

          If you're still not convinced I'm a creative thinker. I am activly challenging my self in
          all areas to think out side of the box. Like why is it out side of the box? Why can't I think
          out side of the cylinder or perhaps the dodecahedron. A box is such an arbitrary shape to think
          out side of? Perhaps a metaphore for going out into the world and the box is supposed to
          represent our generally safe home. Hmmmm.

          You know I'll probably just skip this section because if I was to list ALL of important qualities
          we would be here a while. It's probably best just leave a small code snippet to help justify my
          awesomeness.
